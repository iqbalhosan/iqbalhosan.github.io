The Nuclear Safety and Aerosol Transport Research Group focuses on
understanding fission product transport, aerosol deposition,
critical heat flux, and AI-assisted safety analysis for nuclear
reactors.

Our research supports enhanced reactor safety, severe accident
analysis, and advanced modeling techniques.
## Research Areas

Our research focuses on nuclear reactor safety, aerosol transport,
and AI-assisted modeling.

### Key Topics
- Aerosol transport and deposition in reactor coolant systems
